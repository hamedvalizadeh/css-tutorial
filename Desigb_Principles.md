# Gestalt

it consists of principles/laws of human perception that describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects.

By observing, researching, and identifying examples of human perceptual abilities, designers can design products according to these unifying qualities. In fact, over the last two decades, the work of Gestalt psychologists has been adopted by designers involved in the development of products for human use
